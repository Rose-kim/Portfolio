        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Easier, More Intuitive Solution for Nurses</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">Have you ever seen the interface that nurses use for their charting system? It is really hard to learn and intuitively notice important pieces of information. What if there is a way that could be better? <br><br> Teammates: Rodney Edwards, Amy Kim, Addy Fu, Rose Kim</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---1.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---2-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---2-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---2-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---1.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Hard, Complicated System But Vital for Lifes</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">Our team witnessed the problem from the nurse board that they use everywhere to manage patients&#x27; information. Which caused pain points that first, it had lots of information without a clear hierarchy. Second, that makes nurses hard to glimpse the important information they should focus. Lastly, it was really hard to match patient information with a person because they should see the bed number, check the patient&#x27;s name, and their identify patient number.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---2.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---3-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---3-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---3-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---2.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">How Might We...</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">So I was imagining how to solve this problem that causes chaotic moments or mistakes that don't need to happen. What we did as a team was think about how might we do something different? And we ended up having an imagination what if we can mirror the reality to the interface so that users don't need to match one by one using the list of information given?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---3.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---1-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---1-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---1-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---3.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Sketching & Ideating</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">So I started to sketch the imaginative design based on the idea that we had initially. I set the assumption that the interface will be used in an emergency room that has loads of beds in the same room. And ideated based on physical bed location. I wanted to make sure that vital information can be seen, at the same time glance look is possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---5.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---5-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---5-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---5-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---5.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Mirror the Real World</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">This reference image shows how hard it is when the user needs to match the 2-dimensional information to the 3-dimensional locations. This is the main reason I decided to put every bed and patient information according to the physical location.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---4.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---4-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---4-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---4-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---4.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Color Code</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">It was really important for me to intentionally make this color system for hierarchy, and strictly design interfaces under the color system. Because once I set this mental model for users that red is something really bad, yellow is busy or occupied, green is good and grey is empty, then nurses wouldn't even need to read something on the screen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/ER-Charting-Demo.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Final Design</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">I designed 2 options with light/dark mode for this quick prototype, because of the fact that this interface will be shown 24/7, I didn't want to hurt users' sight. But I also wanted to emphasize emergency situations as possible, so I ended up having a motion for beds that has code blue situations. <br><br> I put the 'most used' buttons and important information on the sidebar, but other than that I made everything goes under the hamburger menu so that nurses don't lose control of detailed cue but also have a glance look.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---6.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---6-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---6-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---6-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---6.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image"><img src="../images/Charting---7.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---7-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---7-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---7-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---7.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image multiple-image-row"><img src="../images/Charting---8.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---8-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---8-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---8-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---8.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image multiple-image-row">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Card Elements</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">The card system was the strategy that I picked for making this idea to reality. Since it can contain different information in the same place while keeping the interface consistent, I designed different card systems for doctors, equipment, bed, and detailed information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---9.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---9-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---9-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---9-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---9.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Prevent Accidental Click</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">One more thing that I carefully designed was a micro-interaction of the 'Code Blue' button. Since it is announcing code blue to entire staff members, it shouldn't be miss-clicked. but the fact that his button is designed to occupy big space so that it is easier to click, I made this 2-step click button so that it will be announced when the user checks it is no mistake.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="playground-post-div"><img src="../images/Charting---10.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Charting---10-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Charting---10-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Charting---10-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Charting---10.png 1200w" alt="" class="playground-post-image">
        <h3 class="playground-post-subheading">Other Interactions</h3>
        <p class="playground-post-p">When nurses press the hamburger menu, it will pop up on the right side and users will be able to drag and drop cards. It will automatically process to call a doctor or request some equipment. While designing this whole system, I learned a lot about the color system and the importance of hierarchy, and how to make the information easy to read.</p>
